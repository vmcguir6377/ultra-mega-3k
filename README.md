Objective: To develop a centralized web application, accessible by all departments, that will streamline the addition and maintenance of the flow of employee data, eliminate data inaccuracy, and reduce redundancy.  The application will contain the following 3 page links:
Employee setup - for HR to initially set up new employee profiles. This data will sync to MDS and Office 365, and will be updated when either of those systems receives updates.
Update wizard - to be used by IT, Dispatch, and Supervisors to update only the specific fields that each would need to change.
Read only - for all others to view pertinent information with no edit permissions.
And will require the following:
Ability to integrate with Office 365 and MDS
Ability to have password authentication for all users to access the proper page per their permission level
Ability to present a read only interface for users who need access to view but not edit

Project Goals:
This restructuring of employee data architecture across ULS systems and software intends to:
Reduce resource consumption by eradicating unnecessary duplication and storage of information
Reduce man hours by eliminating the need for duplicate input of information, and by providing one location to find accurate information 
Increase efficiency, accuracy, and uniformity by providing one hub application that syncs to multiple systems and applications upon entry
Ensure continued information security by requiring password authentication for users and setting permissions per user

Future Development:
The success of the project could allow for removal of the excel spreadsheets, removal of employee data from MDS if that is a redundancy issue, and additional syncing to other applications if necessary, eradicating multiple steps for Human Resources and IT and increasing the efficiency of all departments and data accuracy across the board.
